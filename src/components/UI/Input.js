// This is a React component for rendering an input element with a label. The component is created using the React.forwardRef method to forward the ref to the input element.

// Here's what each part of the code does:

// import React from 'react';: Imports the React library so that the code can use its methods and components.
// import classes from './Input.module.css';: Imports the CSS module for this component. The CSS module is a way to write CSS that is scoped to a specific component, and is usually used to avoid naming conflicts with other CSS classes.
// const Input = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => { ... });: Defines a new React component called Input that takes in some props and a ref, and returns a JSX element. The forwardRef method is used to forward the ref to the input element, which allows the parent component to access the input element's properties and methods.
// <div className={classes.input}>: Creates a div element with a class name of input from the CSS module.
// <label htmlFor={props.input.id}>{props.label}</label>: Renders a label element with a htmlFor attribute that matches the id of the input element. The label text is taken from the label prop.
// <input ref={ref} {...props.input} />: Renders an input element with the ref passed down from the parent component, as well as any additional props passed down as part of the input prop. The ... is the spread syntax, which allows the component to pass all the properties of the input prop to the input element.
// });: Closes the Input component.
// export default Input;: Exports the Input component so that other parts of the code can use it.
