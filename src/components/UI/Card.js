// This is a simple React functional component called Card that accepts props as input and returns a JSX div element with a class name of card.

// The component is importing a CSS module named Card.module.css which defines styles for the card class.

// The props.children property is used here to render any child elements that may be passed into the component when it is used in other parts of the application.

// This component can be used as a wrapper around other elements in order to apply a consistent styling to them throughout the application.
